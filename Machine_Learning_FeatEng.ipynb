    "## This file provides starter code for extracting features from the xml files and\n",
    "## for doing some learning.\n",
    "##\n",
    "## The basic set-up: \n",
    "## ----------------\n",
    "## main() will run code to extract features, learn, and make predictions.\n",
    "## \n",
    "## extract_feats() is called by main(), and it will iterate through the \n",
    "## train/test directories and parse each xml file into an xml.etree.ElementTree, \n",
    "## which is a standard python object used to represent an xml file in memory.\n",
    "## (More information about xml.etree.ElementTree objects can be found here:\n",
    "## http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html\n",
    "## and here: http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/03/15/processing-xml-in-python-with-elementtree/)\n",
    "## It will then use a series of \"feature-functions\" that you will write/modify\n",
    "## in order to extract dictionaries of features from each ElementTree object.\n",
    "## Finally, it will produce an N x D sparse design matrix containing the union\n",
    "## of the features contained in the dictionaries produced by your \"feature-functions.\"\n",
    "## This matrix can then be plugged into your learning algorithm.\n",
    "##\n",
    "## The learning and prediction parts of main() are largely left to you, though\n",
    "## it does contain code that randomly picks class-specific weights and predicts\n",
    "## the class with the weights that give the highest score. If your prediction\n",
    "## algorithm involves class-specific weights, you should, of course, learn \n",
    "## these class-specific weights in a more intelligent way.\n",
    "##\n",
    "## Feature-functions:\n",
    "## --------------------\n",
    "## \"feature-functions\" are functions that take an ElementTree object representing\n",
    "## an xml file (which contains, among other things, the sequence of system calls a\n",
    "## piece of potential malware has made), and returns a dictionary mapping feature names to \n",
    "## their respective numeric values. \n",
    "## For instance, a simple feature-function might map a system call history to the\n",
    "## dictionary {'first_call-load_image': 1}. This is a boolean feature indicating\n",
    "## whether the first system call made by the executable was 'load_image'. \n",
    "## Real-valued or count-based features can of course also be defined in this way. \n",
    "## Because this feature-function will be run over ElementTree objects for each \n",
    "## software execution history instance, we will have the (different)\n",
    "## feature values of this feature for each history, and these values will make up \n",
    "## one of the columns in our final design matrix.\n",
    "## Of course, multiple features can be defined within a single dictionary, and in\n",
    "## the end all the dictionaries returned by feature functions (for a particular\n",
    "## training example) will be unioned, so we can collect all the feature values \n",
    "## associated with that particular instance.\n",
    "##\n",
    "## Two example feature-functions, first_last_system_call_feats() and \n",
    "## system_call_count_feats(), are defined below.\n",
    "## The first of these functions indicates what the first and last system-calls \n",
    "## made by an executable are, and the second records the total number of system\n",
    "## calls made by an executable.\n",
    "##\n",
    "## What you need to do:\n",
    "## --------------------\n",
    "## 1. Write new feature-functions (or modify the example feature-functions) to\n",
    "## extract useful features for this prediction task.\n",
    "## 2. Implement an algorithm to learn from the design matrix produced, and to\n",
    "## make predictions on unseen data. Naive code for these two steps is provided\n",
    "## below, and marked by TODOs.\n",
    "##\n",
    "## Computational Caveat\n",
    "## --------------------\n",
    "## Because the biggest of any of the xml files is only around 35MB, the code below \n",
    "## will parse an entire xml file and store it in memory, compute features, and\n",
    "## then get rid of it before parsing the next one. Storing the biggest of the files \n",
    "## in memory should require at most 200MB or so, which should be no problem for\n",
    "## reasonably modern laptops. If this is too much, however, you can lower the\n",
    "## memory requirement by using ElementTree.iterparse(), which does parsing in\n",
    "## a streaming way. See http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/03/15/processing-xml-in-python-with-elementtree/\n",
    "## for an example. \n",
